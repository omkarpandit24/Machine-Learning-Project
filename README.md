# Machine-Learning-Project
The two most appealing and flourishing technologies in the present world are machine learning and blockchain. In the past decade, research has grown exponentially in both these technologies and these are expected to bring in the next technological revolution. We aim to combine some of the use cases of both these technologies, to predict the topics that people talk about when they mention two most popular cryptocurrencies, i.e. Bitcoin and Ether. Moreover, to find the sentiment flow about these topics and cryptocurrencies among Twitter users. The sentiment can then be used to predict a rise or drop in the value of cryptocurrencies. A higher positive average sentiment value would probably imply a rise in the value as a people are talking good about them whereas, a higher negative average value probably imply
that people are talking negatively about the cryptocurrencies over Twitter.
